### Description

In NocoDB, versions 0.81.0 through 0.83.8 are affected by CSV Injection vulnerability (Formula Injection). A low privileged attacker can create a new table to inject payloads in the table rows. When an administrator accesses the User Management endpoint and exports the data as a CSV file and opens it, the payload gets executed.

### Description

In NocoDB, versions 0.9 to 0.83.8 are vulnerable to Observable Discrepancy in the password-reset feature. When requesting a password reset for a given email address, the application displays an error message when the email isn't registered within the system. This allows attackers to enumerate the registered users' email addresses.

### Description

In Directus, versions 9.0.0-alpha.4 through 9.4.1 allow unrestricted file upload of .html files in the media upload functionality, which leads to Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. A low privileged attacker can upload a crafted HTML file as a profile avatar, and when an admin or another user opens it, the XSS payload gets triggered.

### Description

In Teedy, versions v1.5 through v1.9 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the name of a created Tag. Since the Tag name is not being sanitized properly in the edit tag page, a low privileged attacker can store malicious scripts in the name of the Tag. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account Takeover of the administrator, and privileges escalation.

### Description

In Teedy, versions v1.5 through v1.9 are vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The “search term" search functionality is not sufficiently sanitized while displaying the results of the search, which can be leveraged to inject arbitrary scripts. These scripts are executed in a victim’s browser when they enter the crafted URL. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account Takeover of the administrator, by an unauthenticated attacker.

### Description

In DayByDay CRM, versions 2.2.0 through 2.2.1 (latest) are vulnerable to Insufficient Session Expiration. When a password has been changed by the user or by an administrator, a user that was already logged in, will still have access to the application even after the password was changed.

### Description

In DayByDay CRM, version 2.2.0 is vulnerable to missing authorization. Any application user in the application who has update user permission enabled is able to change the password of other users, including the administrator’s. This allows the attacker to gain access to the highest privileged user in the application.

### Description

In Daybyday CRM, versions 1.1 through 2.2.0 enforce weak password requirements in the user update functionality. A user with privileges to update his password could change it to a weak password, such as those with a length of a single character. This may allow an attacker to brute-force users’ passwords with minimal to no computational effort.
